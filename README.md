Customer Segmentation with RFM Analysis and Clustering

Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) framework and clustering techniques. The goal is to group customers based on their purchasing behavior to provide actionable insights for targeted marketing strategies.

The analysis is performed on the Online Retail II dataset, which contains transactional data from a UK-based retailer. The dataset is available on Kaggle and includes information such as invoices, product details, customer IDs, and transaction amounts.

Key Features

Handled missing values, outliers, and data inconsistencies.
Created meaningful features like total transaction value and derived RFM metrics.

RFM Analysis:
Computed Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values for each customer.
Assigned RFM scores based on quartiles to rank customers.

Clustering with K-Means:
Used standardized RFM metrics to segment customers into groups.
Analyzed each segment for actionable insights.

Visualization and Insights:
Clear visualizations of RFM metrics and clusters.
Practical recommendations for marketing strategies tailored to each segment.
